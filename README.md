This is an alternate version of my Etch-A-Sketch project from The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)

The difference is that the non-opaque option in this one does have overlap, allowing some color blending. That said, version 1 runs much smoother at higher grid size numbers because version 2 creates a new div on top of the previous one with every mouseenter event rather than just changing the styling of the already existing divs.
